Similarly, XML::Node#inner_html will serialize the children of a given node. (This is the equivalent of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML .) Due to quirks in how HTML is parsed and serialized, it's possible for a DOM tree to be serialized and then re-parsed, resulting in a different DOM. Mostly, this happens with DOMs produced from invalid HTML. Unfortunately, even valid HTML may not survive serialization and re-parsing. In particular, a newline at the start of pre , listing , and textarea elements is ignored by the parser. In this case, the original HTML is semantically equivalent to the serialized version. If the pre , listing , or textarea content starts with two newlines, the first newline will be stripped on the first parse and the second newline will be stripped on the second, leading to semantically different DOMs. Passing the parameter preserve_newline: true will cause two or more newlines to be preserved.

Nokogiri provides two different event based parsers when dealing with XML. If you want to do SAX style parsing using HTML, check out Nokogiri::HTML4::SAX. The basic way a SAX style parser works is by creating a parser, telling the parser about the events we're interested in, then giving the parser some XML to process. The parser will notify you when it encounters events you said you would like to know about. To register for events, you simply subclass Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Document, and implement the methods for which you would like notification. For example, if I want to be notified when a document ends, and when an element starts, I would write a class like this: Then I would instantiate a SAX parser with this document, and feed the parser some XML Now my document handler will be called when each node starts, and when then document ends. To see what kinds of events are available, take a look at Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Document. Two SAX parsers for XML are available, a parser that reads from a string or IO object as it feels necessary, and a parser that lets you spoon feed it XML. If you want to let Nokogiri deal with reading your XML, use the Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Parser.

Reading \u00b6 Your first stops for learning more about Nokogiri should be: API Documentation Tutorials An excellent community-maintained Cheat Sheet Ask For Help \u00b6 There are a few ways to ask exploratory questions: The Ruby Discord chat server is active at https://discord.gg/UyQnKrT The Nokogiri mailing list is active at https://groups.google.com/group/nokogiri-talk Open an issue using the \"Help Request\" template at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues Please do not mail the maintainers at their personal addresses. Report A Bug \u00b6 The Nokogiri bug tracker is at https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/issues Please use the \"Bug Report\" or \"Installation Difficulties\" templates. Security and Vulnerability Reporting \u00b6 Please report vulnerabilities at https://hackerone.com/nokogiri Full information and description of our security policy is in SECURITY.md Semantic Versioning Policy \u00b6 Nokogiri follows Semantic Versioning (since 2017 or so). We bump Major.Minor.Patch versions following this guidance: Major : (we've never done this) Significant backwards-incompatible changes to the public API that would require rewriting existing application code. Some examples of backwards-incompatible changes we might someday consider for a Major release are at ROADMAP.md . Minor : Features and bugfixes. Updating packaged libraries for non-security-related reasons. Dropping support for EOLed Ruby versions. Some folks find this objectionable , but SemVer says this is OK if the public API hasn't changed . Backwards-incompatible changes to internal or private methods and constants. These are detailed in the \"Changes\" section of each changelog entry. Patch : Bugfixes. Security updates. Updating packaged libraries for security-related reasons. Installation \u00b6 Requirements: Ruby >= 2.5 JRuby >= 9.2.0.0 Native Gems: Faster, more reliable installation \u00b6 \"Native gems\" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries, or for system dependencies to exist. This results in much faster installation and more reliable installation , which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users. Supported Platforms \u00b6 As of v1.11.0, Nokogiri ships pre-compiled, \"native\" gems for the following platforms: Linux: x86-linux and x86_64-linux (req: glibc >= 2.17 ), including musl platforms like Alpine Darwin/MacOS: x86_64-darwin and arm64-darwin Windows: x86-mingw32 and x64-mingw32 Java: any platform running JRuby 9.2 or higher To determine whether your system supports one of these gems, look at the output of bundle platform or ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s' . If you're on a supported platform, either gem install or bundle install should install a native gem without any additional action on your part. This installation should only take a few seconds, and your output should look something like: $ gem install nokogiri Fetching nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux.gem Successfully installed nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux 1 gem installed Other Installation Options \u00b6 Because Nokogiri is a C extension, it requires that you have a C compiler toolchain, Ruby development header files, and some system dependencies installed. The following may work for you if you have an appropriately-configured system: gem install nokogiri If you have any issues, please visit Installing Nokogiri for more complete instructions and troubleshooting. How To Use Nokogiri \u00b6 Nokogiri is a large library, and so it's challenging to briefly summarize it. We've tried to provide long, real-world examples at Tutorials . Parsing and Querying \u00b6 Here is example usage for parsing and querying a document: #! /usr/bin/env ruby require 'nokogiri' require 'open-uri' # Fetch and parse HTML document doc = Nokogiri :: HTML ( URI . open ( 'https://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html' )) # Search for nodes by css doc . css ( 'nav ul.menu li a' , 'article h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end # Search for nodes by xpath doc . xpath ( '//nav//ul//li/a' , '//article//h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end # Or mix and match doc . search ( 'nav ul.menu li a' , '//article//h2' ) . each do | link | puts link . content end Encoding \u00b6 Strings are always stored as UTF-8 internally. Methods that return text values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings. Methods that return a string containing markup (like to_xml , to_html and inner_html ) will return a string encoded like the source document. WARNING Some documents declare one encoding, but actually use a different one. In these cases, which encoding should the parser choose? Data is just a stream of bytes. Humans add meaning to that stream. Any particular set of bytes could be valid characters in multiple encodings, so detecting encoding with 100% accuracy is not possible. libxml2 does its best, but it can't be right all the time. If you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your best bet is to explicitly set the encoding. Here is an example of explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser: doc = Nokogiri . XML ( '<foo><bar /></foo>' , nil , 'EUC-JP' ) Technical Overview \u00b6 Guiding Principles \u00b6 As noted above, two guiding principles of the software are: be secure-by-default by treating all documents as untrusted by default be a thin-as-reasonable layer on top of the underlying parsers, and don't attempt to fix behavioral differences between the parsers Notably, despite all parsers being standards-compliant, there are behavioral inconsistencies between the parsers used in the CRuby and JRuby implementations, and Nokogiri does not and should not attempt to remove these inconsistencies. Instead, we surface these differences in the test suite when they are important/semantic; or we intentionally write tests to depend only on the important/semantic bits (omitting whitespace from regex matchers on results, for example). CRuby \u00b6 The Ruby (a.k.a., CRuby, MRI, YARV) implementation is a C extension that depends on libxml2 and libxslt (which in turn depend on zlib and possibly libiconv). These dependencies are met by default by Nokogiri's packaged versions of the libxml2 and libxslt source code, but a configuration option --use-system-libraries is provided to allow specification of alternative library locations. See Installing Nokogiri for full documentation. We provide native gems by pre-compiling libxml2 and libxslt (and potentially zlib and libiconv) and packaging them into the gem file. In this case, no compilation is necessary at installation time, which leads to faster and more reliable installation. See LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md for more information on which dependencies are provided in which native and source gems. JRuby \u00b6 The Java (a.k.a. JRuby) implementation is a Java extension that depends primarily on Xerces and NekoHTML for parsing, though additional dependencies are on isorelax , nekodtd , jing , serializer , xalan-j , and xml-apis . These dependencies are provided by pre-compiled jar files packaged in the java platform gem. See LICENSE-DEPENDENCIES.md for more information on which dependencies are provided in which native and source gems. Contributing \u00b6 See CONTRIBUTING.md for an intro guide to developing Nokogiri.

Affected systems include RHEL6, RHEL7, and SLES12. [ #2302 ] 1.12.2 / 2021-08-04 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] Ensure that C extension files in non-native gem installations are loaded using require and rely on $LOAD_PATH instead of using require_relative . This issue only exists when deleting shared libraries that exist outside the extensions directory, something users occasionally do to conserve disk space. [ #2300 ] 1.12.1 / 2021-08-03 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] Fix compilation of libgumbo on BSD systems by avoiding GNU-isms. [ #2298 ] 1.12.0 / 2021-08-02 \u00b6 Notable Addition: HTML5 Support (CRuby only) \u00b6 HTML5 support has been added (to CRuby only) by merging Nokogumbo into Nokogiri. The Nokogumbo public API has been preserved, so this functionality is available under the Nokogiri::HTML5 namespace. [ #2204 ] Please note that HTML5 support is not available for JRuby in this version. However, we feel it is important to think about JRuby and we hope to work on this in the future. If you're interested in helping with HTML5 support on JRuby, please reach out to the maintainers by commenting on issue #2227 . Many thanks to Sam Ruby, Steve Checkoway, and Craig Barnes for creating and maintaining Nokogumbo and supporting the Gumbo HTML5 parser. They're now Nokogiri core contributors with all the powers and privileges pertaining thereto. \ud83d\ude4c Notable Change: Nokogiri::HTML4 module and namespace \u00b6 Nokogiri::HTML has been renamed to Nokogiri::HTML4 , and Nokogiri::HTML is aliased to preserve backwards-compatibility. Nokogiri::HTML and Nokogiri::HTML4 parse methods still use libxml2's (or NekoHTML's) HTML4 parser in the v1.12 release series. Take special note that if you rely on the class name of an object in your code, objects will now report a class of Nokogiri::HTML4::Foo where they previously reported Nokogiri::HTML::Foo . Instead of relying on the string returned by Object#class , prefer Class#=== or Object#is_a? or Object#instance_of? . Future releases of Nokogiri may deprecate HTML methods or otherwise change this behavior, so please start using HTML4 in place of HTML . Added \u00b6 [CRuby] Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO[\"libxslt\"][\"datetime_enabled\"] is a new boolean value which describes whether libxslt (or, more properly, libexslt) has compiled-in datetime support. This generally going to be true , but some distros ship without this support (e.g., some mingw UCRT-based packages, see https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/pull/8957 ). See #2272 for more details. Changed \u00b6 Introduce a new constant, Nokogiri::XML::ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XSLT , which adds the libxslt-preferred options of NOENT | DTDLOAD | DTDATTR | NOCDATA to ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XML . Nokogiri.XSLT parses stylesheets using ParseOptions::DEFAULT_XSLT , which should make some edge-case XSL transformations match libxslt's default behavior. [ #1940 ] Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] Namespaced attributes are handled properly when their parent node is reparented into another document. Previously, the namespace may have gotten dropped. [ #2228 ] [CRuby] Reparented nodes no longer inherit their parent's namespace. Previously, a node without a namespace was forced to adopt its parent's namespace. [ #1712 ] Improved \u00b6 [CRuby] Speed up (slightly) the compile time of packaged libraries libiconv , libxml2 , and libxslt by using autoconf's --disable-dependency-tracking option. (\"ruby\" platform gem only.) Deprecated \u00b6 Deprecating Nokogumbo's Nokogiri::HTML5.get . This method will be removed in a future version of Nokogiri. Dependencies \u00b6 [CRuby] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from ~> 2.5.0 to ~> 2.6.1 . (\"ruby\" platform gem only.) 1.11.7 / 2021-06-02 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] Backporting an upstream fix to XPath recursion depth limits which impacted some users of complex XPath queries. This issue is present in libxml 2.9.11 and 2.9.12. [ #2257 ] 1.11.6 / 2021-05-26 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] DocumentFragment#path now does proper error-checking to handle behavior introduced in libxml > 2.9.10. In v1.11.4 and v1.11.5, calling DocumentFragment#path could result in a segfault. 1.11.5 / 2021-05-19 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [Windows CRuby] Work around segfault at process exit on Windows when using libxml2 system DLLs. libxml 2.9.12 introduced new behavior to avoid memory leaks when unloading libxml2 shared libraries (see libxml/!66 ). Early testing caught this segfault on non-Windows platforms (see #2059 and libxml@956534e ) but it was incompletely fixed and is still an issue on Windows platforms that are using system DLLs. We work around this by configuring libxml2 in this situation to use its default memory management functions. Note that if Nokogiri is not on Windows, or is not using shared system libraries, it will will continue to configure libxml2 to use Ruby's memory management functions. Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO[\"libxml\"][\"memory_management\"] will allow you to verify when the default memory management functions are being used. [ #2241 ] Added \u00b6 Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO[\"libxml\"] now contains the key \"memory_management\" to declare whether libxml2 is using its default memory management functions, or whether it uses the memory management functions from ruby . See above for more details. 1.11.4 / 2021-05-14 \u00b6 Security \u00b6 [CRuby] Vendored libxml2 upgraded to v2.9.12 which addresses: CVE-2019-20388 CVE-2020-24977 CVE-2021-3517 CVE-2021-3518 CVE-2021-3537 CVE-2021-3541 Note that two additional CVEs were addressed upstream but are not relevant to this release. CVE-2021-3516 via xmllint is not present in Nokogiri, and CVE-2020-7595 has been patched in Nokogiri since v1.10.8 (see #1992 ). Please see nokogiri/GHSA-7rrm-v45f-jp64 or #2233 for a more complete analysis of these CVEs and patches. Dependencies \u00b6 [CRuby] vendored libxml2 is updated from 2.9.10 to 2.9.12. (Note that 2.9.11 was skipped because it was superseded by 2.9.12 a few hours after its release.) 1.11.3 / 2021-04-07 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] Passing non- Node objects to Document#root= now raises an ArgumentError exception. Previously this likely segfaulted. [ #1900 ] [JRuby] Passing non- Node objects to Document#root= now raises an ArgumentError exception. Previously this raised a TypeError exception. [CRuby] arm64/aarch64 systems (like Apple's M1) can now compile libxml2 and libxslt from source (though we continue to strongly advise users to install the native gems for the best possible experience) 1.11.2 / 2021-03-11 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] NodeSet may now safely contain Node objects from multiple documents. Previously the GC lifecycle of the parent Document objects could lead to nodes being GCed while still in scope. [ #1952 ] [CRuby] Patch libxml2 to avoid \"huge input lookup\" errors on large CDATA elements. (See upstream GNOME/libxml2#200 and GNOME/libxml2!100 .) [ #2132 ]. [CRuby+Windows] Enable Nokogumbo (and other downstream gems) to compile and link against nokogiri.so by including LDFLAGS in Nokogiri::VERSION_INFO . [ #2167 ] [CRuby] {XML,HTML}::Document.parse now invokes #initialize exactly once. Previously #initialize was invoked twice on each object. [JRuby] {XML,HTML}::Document.parse now invokes #initialize exactly once. Previously #initialize was not called, which was a problem for subclassing such as done by Loofah . Improved \u00b6 Reduce the number of object allocations needed when parsing an HTML::DocumentFragment . [ #2087 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) [JRuby] Update the algorithm used to calculate Node#line to be wrong less-often. The underlying parser, Xerces, does not track line numbers, and so we've always used a hacky solution for this method. [ #1223 , #2177 ] Introduce --enable-system-libraries and --disable-system-libraries flags to extconf.rb . These flags provide the same functionality as --use-system-libraries and the NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES environment variable, but are more idiomatic. [ #2193 ] (Thanks, @eregon !) [TruffleRuby] --disable-static is now the default on TruffleRuby when the packaged libraries are used. This is more flexible and compiles faster. (Note, though, that the default on TR is still to use system libraries.) [ #2191 , #2193 ] (Thanks, @eregon !) Changed \u00b6 Nokogiri::XML::Path is now a Module (previously it has been a Class). It has been acting solely as a Module since v1.0.0. See 8461c74 . 1.11.1 / 2021-01-06 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [CRuby] If libxml-ruby is loaded before nokogiri , the SAX and Push parsers no longer call libxml-ruby 's handlers. Instead, they defensively override the libxml2 global handler before parsing. [ #2168 ] 1.11.0 / 2021-01-03 \u00b6 Notes \u00b6 Faster, more reliable installation: Native Gems for Linux and OSX/Darwin \"Native gems\" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries. This results in much faster installation and more reliable installation , which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users. We've been shipping native Windows gems since 2009, but starting in v1.11.0 we are also shipping native gems for these platforms: Linux: x86-linux and x86_64-linux -- including musl platforms like alpine OSX/Darwin: x86_64-darwin and arm64-darwin We'd appreciate your thoughts and feedback on this work at #2075 . Dependencies \u00b6 Ruby This release introduces support for Ruby 2.7 and 3.0 in the precompiled native gems. This release ends support for: Ruby 2.3, for which official support ended on 2019-03-31 [ #1886 ] (Thanks @ashmaroli !) Ruby 2.4, for which official support ended on 2020-04-05 JRuby 9.1, which is the Ruby 2.3-compatible release. Gems Explicitly add racc as a runtime dependency. [ #1988 ] (Thanks, @voxik !) [MRI] Upgrade mini_portile2 dependency from ~> 2.4.0 to ~> 2.5.0 [ #2005 ] (Thanks, @alejandroperea !) Security \u00b6 See note below about CVE-2020-26247 in the \"Changed\" subsection entitled \"XML::Schema parsing treats input as untrusted by default\". Added \u00b6 Add Node methods for manipulating \"keyword attributes\" (for example, class and rel ): #kwattr_values , #kwattr_add , #kwattr_append , and #kwattr_remove . [ #2000 ] Add support for CSS queries a:has(> b) , a:has(~ b) , and a:has(+ b) . [ #688 ] (Thanks, @jonathanhefner !) Add Node#value? to better match expected semantics of a Hash-like object. [ #1838 , #1840 ] (Thanks, @MatzFan !) [CRuby] Add Nokogiri::XML::Node#line= for use by downstream libs like nokogumbo. [ #1918 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) nokogiri.gemspec is back after a 10-year hiatus. We still prefer you use the official releases, but main is pretty stable these days, and YOLO. Performance \u00b6 [CRuby] The CSS ~= operator and class selector . are about 2x faster. [ #2137 , #2135 ] [CRuby] Patch libxml2 to call strlen from xmlStrlen rather than the naive implementation, because strlen is generally optimized for the architecture. [ #2144 ] (Thanks, @ilyazub !) Improve performance of some namespace operations. [ #1916 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Remove unnecessary array allocations from Node serialization methods [ #1911 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Avoid creation of unnecessary zero-length String objects. [ #1970 ] (Thanks, @ashmaroli !) Always compile libxml2 and libxslt with '-O2' [ #2022 , #2100 ] (Thanks, @ilyazub !) [JRuby] Lots of code cleanup and performance improvements. [ #1934 ] (Thanks, @kares !) [CRuby] RelaxNG.from_document no longer leaks memory. [ #2114 ] Improved \u00b6 [CRuby] Handle incorrectly-closed HTML comments as WHATWG recommends for browsers. [ #2058 ] (Thanks to HackerOne user mayflower for reporting this!) {HTML,XML}::Document#parse now accept Pathname objects. Previously this worked only if the referenced file was less than 4096 bytes long; longer files resulted in undefined behavior because the read method would be repeatedly invoked. [ #1821 , #2110 ] (Thanks, @doriantaylor and @phokz !) [CRuby] Nokogumbo builds faster because it can now use header files provided by Nokogiri. [ #1788 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) Add frozen_string_literal: true magic comment to all lib files. [ #1745 ] (Thanks, @oniofchaos !) [JRuby] Clean up deprecated calls into JRuby. [ #2027 ] (Thanks, @headius !) Fixed \u00b6 HTML Parsing in \"strict\" mode (i.e., the RECOVER parse option not set) now correctly raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Previously the value of the RECOVER bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby. [ #2130 ] The CSS ~= operator now correctly handles non-space whitespace in the class attribute. commit e45dedd The switch to turn off the CSS-to-XPath cache is now thread-local, rather than being shared mutable state. [ #1935 ] The Node methods add_previous_sibling , previous= , before , add_next_sibling , next= , after , replace , and swap now correctly use their parent as the context node for parsing markup. These methods now also raise a RuntimeError if they are called on a node with no parent. [ nokogumbo#160 ] [JRuby] XML::Schema XSD validation errors are captured in XML::Schema#errors . These errors were previously ignored. [JRuby] Standardize reading from IO like objects, including StringIO. [ #1888 , #1897 ] [JRuby] Fix how custom XPath function namespaces are inferred to be less naive. [ #1890 , #2148 ] [JRuby] Clarify exception message when custom XPath functions can't be resolved. [JRuby] Comparison of Node to Document with Node#<=> now matches CRuby/libxml2 behavior. [CRuby] Syntax errors are now correctly captured in Document#errors for short HTML documents. Previously the SAX parser used for encoding detection was clobbering libxml2's global error handler. [CRuby] Fixed installation on AIX with respect to vasprintf . [ #1908 ] [CRuby] On some platforms, avoid symbol name collision with glibc's canonicalize . [ #2105 ] [Windows Visual C++] Fixed compiler warnings and errors. [ #2061 , #2068 ] [CRuby] Fixed Nokogumbo integration which broke in the v1.11.0 release candidates. [ #1788 ] (Thanks, @stevecheckoway !) [JRuby] Fixed document encoding regression in v1.11.0 release candidates. [ #2080 , #2083 ] (Thanks, @thbar !) Removed \u00b6 The internal method Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.cache_on= has been removed. Use .set_cache if you need to muck with the cache internals. The class method Nokogiri::CSS::Parser.parse has been removed. This was originally deprecated in 2009 in 13db61b. Use Nokogiri::CSS.parse instead. Changed \u00b6 XML::Schema input is now \"untrusted\" by default Address CVE-2020-26247 . In Nokogiri versions <= 1.11.0.rc3, XML Schemas parsed by Nokogiri::XML::Schema were trusted by default, allowing external resources to be accessed over the network, potentially enabling XXE or SSRF attacks. This behavior is counter to the security policy intended by Nokogiri maintainers, which is to treat all input as untrusted by default whenever possible. Please note that this security fix was pushed into a new minor version, 1.11.x, rather than a patch release to the 1.10.x branch, because it is a breaking change for some schemas and the risk was assessed to be \"Low Severity\". More information and instructions for enabling \"trusted input\" behavior in v1.11.0.rc4 and later is available at the public advisory . HTML parser now obeys the strict or norecover parsing option (Also noted above in the \"Fixed\" section) HTML Parsing in \"strict\" mode (i.e., the RECOVER parse option not set) now correctly raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Previously the value of the RECOVER bit was being ignored by CRuby and was misinterpreted by JRuby. If you're using the default parser options, you will be unaffected by this fix. If you're passing strict or norecover to your HTML parser call, you may be surprised to see that the parser now fails to recover and raises a XML::SyntaxError exception. Given the number of HTML documents on the internet that libxml2 would consider to be ill-formed, this is probably not what you want, and you can omit setting that parse option to restore the behavior that you have been relying upon. Apologies to anyone inconvenienced by this breaking bugfix being present in a minor release, but I felt it was appropriate to introduce this fix because it's straightforward to fix any code that has been relying on this buggy behavior. VersionInfo , the output of nokogiri -v , and related constants This release changes the metadata provided in Nokogiri::VersionInfo which also affects the output of nokogiri -v . Some related constants have also been changed. If you're using VersionInfo programmatically, or relying on constants related to underlying library versions, please read the detailed changes for Nokogiri::VersionInfo at #2139 and accept our apologies for the inconvenience. 1.10.10 / 2020-07-06 \u00b6 Features \u00b6 [MRI] Cross-built Windows gems now support Ruby 2.7 [ #2029 ]. Note that prior to this release, the v1.11.x prereleases provided this support. 1.10.9 / 2020-03-01 \u00b6 Fixed \u00b6 [MRI] Raise an exception when Nokogiri detects a specific libxml2 edge case involving blank Schema nodes wrapped by Ruby objects that would cause a segfault. Currently no fix is available upstream, so we're preventing a dangerous operation and informing users to code around it if possible. [ #1985 , #2001 ] [JRuby] Change NodeSet#to_a to return a RubyArray instead of Object, for compilation under JRuby 9.2.9 and later. [ #1968 , #1969 ] (Thanks, @headius !) 1.10.8 / 2020-02-10 \u00b6 Security \u00b6 [MRI] Pulled in upstream patch from libxml that addresses CVE-2020-7595. Full details are available in #1992 .

A command injection vulnerability in Nokogiri v1.10.3 and earlier allows commands to be executed in a subprocess by Ruby's Kernel.open method. Processes are vulnerable only if the undocumented method Nokogiri::CSS::Tokenizer#load_file is being passed untrusted user input. This vulnerability appears in code generated by the Rexical gem versions v1.0.6 and earlier. Rexical is used by Nokogiri to generate lexical scanner code for parsing CSS queries. The underlying vulnerability was addressed in Rexical v1.0.7 and Nokogiri upgraded to this version of Rexical in Nokogiri v1.10.4.

This doc is intended to be a short introduction on how to modify and maintain Nokogiri. If you're looking for guidance on filing a bug report or getting support, please visit the \"Getting Help\" tutorial at the nokogiri.org site. Contents \u00b6 Introduction Some guiding principles of the project Where to start getting involved Submitting Pull Requests How to set up your local development environment How to run the tests Style Guide How Continuous Integration (\"CI\") is configured Building gems Other utilities Rake tasks Making a release Code of Conduct Introduction \u00b6 Hello there! I'm super excited that you're interested in contributing to Nokogiri. Welcome! This document is intended only to provide a brief introduction on how to contribute to Nokogiri. It's not a complete specification of everything you need to know, so if you want to know more, I encourage you to reach out to the maintainers in the Discord channel . We'd love to get to know you a bit better! Some guiding principles of the project \u00b6 The top guiding principles, as noted in the README are: be secure-by-default by treating all documents as untrusted by default be a thin-as-reasonable layer on top of the underlying parsers, and don't attempt to fix behavioral differences between the parsers Nokogiri supports both CRuby and JRuby, and has native code specific to each (though much Ruby code is shared between them). Some related secondary principles are: Whenever possible, implement the same functionality for both CRuby and JRuby. Whenever possible, implement shared behavior as shared Ruby code (i.e., write as little native code as reasonable). Whenever possible, write tests that are not platform-specific (which includes skipping). Notably, despite all parsers being standards-compliant, there are behavioral inconsistencies between the parsers used in the CRuby and JRuby implementations, and Nokogiri does not and should not attempt to remove these inconsistencies. Instead, we surface these differences in the test suite when they are important/semantic; or we intentionally write tests to depend only on the important/semantic bits (omitting whitespace from regex matchers on results, for example). Nokogiri is widely used in the Ruby ecosystem, and so extra care should be taken to avoid introducing breaking changes. Please read our Semantic Versioning Policy to understand what we consider to be a breaking change. Where to start getting involved \u00b6 Please take a look at our Issues marked \"Help Wanted\" . Also, pull requests for documentation improvements are always welcome! Submitting Pull Requests \u00b6 Pull requests that introduce behavior change must always contain a test demonstrating the behavior being introduced, fixed, or changed. These tests should ideally communicate to the maintainers the problem being solved. We will ask you for clarification if we don't understand the problem you're trying to solve. Please do not submit pull requests that make purely cosmetic changes to the code (style, naming, etc.). While we recognize that the code can always be improved, we would prefer you to focus on more impactful contributions. Feel free to push a \"work in progress\" to take advantage of the feedback loops from CI. But then please indicate that it's still in progress by marking it as a Draft Pull Request . How to set up your local development environment \u00b6 Basic \u00b6 Clone https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri and run bundle install . Advanced \u00b6 Please install the latest or previous version of CRuby (e.g., 3.0 or 2.7 as of 2021-02), and a recent version of JRuby. We recommend using rbenv , which is used in test scripts when necessary to test gems against multiple rubies. Please install a system version of libxml2/libxslt (see Installing Nokogiri for details) so that you can test against both the packaged libraries and your system libraries. We recommend that you install valgrind if you can, but it's only necessary for debugging problems so feel free to wait until you need it. (I'm not sure valgrind is easily available on MacOS.) If you plan to package precompiled native gems, make sure docker is installed and is working properly. How to run the tests \u00b6 Note that rake test does not compile the native extension, and this is intentional. If you're modifying the extension code, please make sure you re-compile each time you run the tests to ensure you're testing your changes. The short version \u00b6 bundle exec rake compile test CRuby advanced usage \u00b6 Test using your system's libraries: bundle exec rake clean # blow away pre-existing libraries using packaged libs NOKOGIRI_USE_SYSTEM_LIBRARIES = t bundle exec rake compile test Run tests using valgrind: bundle exec rake compile test:valgrind Run tests in the debugger: bundle exec rake compile test:gdb Note that by default the test suite will run a major GC after each test completes. This has shown to be useful for localizing entire classes of memory bugs, but does slow the suite down. Some variations of the test suite behavior are available (see test/helper.rb for more info): # see failure messages immediately NOKOGIRI_TEST_FAIL_FAST = t bundle exec rake compile test # ordinary GC behavior NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = normal bundle exec rake compile test # minor GC after each test NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = minor bundle exec rake compile test # major GC after each test NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = major bundle exec rake compile test # major GC after each test and GC compaction after every 20 tests NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = compact bundle exec rake compile test # verify references after compaction after every 20 tests # (see https://alanwu.space/post/check-compaction/) NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = verify bundle exec rake compile test # run with GC \"stress mode\" on NOKOGIRI_TEST_GC_LEVEL = stress bundle exec rake compile test libxml2 advanced usage \u00b6 If you want to build Nokogiri against a modified version of libxml2, clone libxml2 to ../libxml2 and then run scripts/compile-against-libxml2-source . That script also takes an optional command to run with the proper environment variables set to use the local libxml2 library, which can be useful when trying to git bisect against libxml2. gumbo HTML5 parser \u00b6 To run the test suite for the gumbo parser: bundle exec rake gumbo To make sure to run additional html5lib tests for Nokogiri's HTML5 parser: git submodule update --init # test/html5lib-tests bundle exec rake compile test Style Guide \u00b6 I don't feel very strongly about code style, but when possible I follow Shopify's Ruby Style Guide , and for C and Java code I use the astyle settings laid out in /rakelib/format.rake . You can format the C and Java code with rake format . Maybe someday I'll auto-format Ruby, but not today. No, I don't want to talk to you about this. How Continuous Integration (\"CI\") is configured \u00b6 The bulk of CI is running in Github Actions since May 2021: https://github.com/sparklemotion/nokogiri/actions However, we also run tests against 32-bit windows (which aren't supported by GA as of this writing) in Appveyor: https://ci.appveyor.com/project/flavorjones/nokogiri Please note that there are some known holes in CI coverage due to actions/download-artifact (as well as other actions) not supporting systems other than 64-bit glibc: installing ruby and native gems on Alpine/musl installing ruby and native gems on 32-bit Linux For more information, please check out #2244 and #2247 which document the migration from Concourse to Github Actions. Coverage \u00b6 The ci.yml pipeline includes jobs to: basic security sanity check: run rubocop fast feedback for obvious failures: run against system libraries on vanilla ubuntu run the gumbo parser tests on ubuntu, macos, and windows run on all supported versions of CRuby: once with packaged libraries once with system libraries once on valgrind (to look for memory bugs) run on JRuby run on a Musl (Alpine) system: against system libraries with valgrind using packaged libraries run with libxml-ruby loaded (because this interacts with libxml2 in conflicting ways) against system libraries with valgrind using packaged libraries The upstream.yml pipeline includes jobs to: run against CRuby head (linux, windows, macos) including valgrind run against JRuby head run against libxml2 and libxslt head (linux only today) including valgrind The gem-install.yml pipeline includes jobs to: build a \"ruby\" platform gem install and test on linux, macos, and windows build a native 64-bit gem (linux, macos, windows) install and test against all supported versions of CRuby install and test on musl build a jruby gem, install and test it The truffle.yml pipeline tests TruffleRuby nightlies with a few different compile-time flags. TruffleRuby support is still experimental due to Sulong limitations, and the test suite is exceedingly slow when run by TR, so this pipeline doesn't run on pushes and PRs. Instead, it runs periodically on a timer to give us some signal without slowing down developer feedback loops. Valgrind \u00b6 We rely heavily on Valgrind to catch memory bugs by running in combination with every version of CRuby. We use suppressions, too -- because some Rubies seem to have memory issues? See the files in the /suppressions directory and /rakelib/test.rake for more information. Conventions \u00b6 Always checkout the source code including submodules (for the html5lib tests) When testing packaged libraries (not system libraries), cache either ports/ (for compiled libraries) or ports/archives/ (for just tarballs) note that libgumbo is built outside of ports/ to allow us to do this caching safely Building gems \u00b6 As a prerequisite please make sure you have docker correctly installed. Run scripts/build-gems which will package gems for all supported platforms, and run some basic sanity tests on those packages using scripts/test-gem-set , scripts/test-gem-file-contents , and scripts/test-gem-installation .

Some related secondary principles are: Whenever possible, implement the same functionality for both CRuby and JRuby. Whenever possible, implement shared behavior as shared Ruby code (i.e., write as little native code as reasonable). Whenever possible, write tests that are not platform-specific (which includes skipping). Notably, despite all parsers being standards-compliant, there are behavioral inconsistencies between the parsers used in the CRuby and JRuby implementations, and Nokogiri does not and should not attempt to remove these inconsistencies. Instead, we surface these differences in the test suite when they are important/semantic; or we intentionally write tests to depend only on the important/semantic bits (omitting whitespace from regex matchers on results, for example). Nokogiri is widely used in the Ruby ecosystem, and so extra care should be taken to avoid introducing breaking changes. Please read our Semantic Versioning Policy to understand what we consider to be a breaking change.","title":"Some guiding principles of the project"},{"location":"CONTRIBUTING.html#where-to-start-getting-involved","text":"Please take a look at our Issues marked \"Help Wanted\" .

You can double-check the dependencies in your gem file by examining the output of nokogiri -v after installation, which will emit the complete set of libraries in use (for versions >= 1.11.0.rc4 ). In particular, I'm sure somebody's lawyer, somewhere, is going to freak out that the LGPL appears in this file; and so I'd like to take special note that the dependency covered by LGPL, libiconv , is only being redistributed in the native Windows and native Darwin platform releases. It's not present in default, Java\u24c7, or native Linux\u24c7 releases. Platform Releases \u00b6 Default platform release (\"ruby\") \u00b6 The default platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt libgumbo and nokogumbo This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have the value \"ruby\" for its \"platform\" attribute. Native Linux\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86_64-linux\" and \"arm64-linux\") \u00b6 The native Linux\u24c7 platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt libgumbo and nokogumbo zlib This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-linux\" or \"x86-linux\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Native Darwin (macOS\u24c7) platform releases (\"x86_64-darwin\" and \"arm64-darwin\") \u00b6 The native Darwin platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt libgumbo and nokogumbo zlib libiconv This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x86_64-darwin\" or \"arm64-darwin\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute. Darwin is also known more familiarly as \"OSX\" or \"macOS\u24c7\" and is the operating system for many Apple\u24c7 computers. Native Windows\u24c7 platform releases (\"x86-mingw32\" and \"x64-mingw32\") \u00b6 The native Windows\u24c7 platform release distributes the following dependencies in source form: libxml2 libxslt libgumbo and nokogumbo zlib libiconv This distribution can be identified by inspecting the included Gem::Specification, which will have a value similar to \"x64-mingw32\" or \"x86-mingw32\" for its \"platform.cpu\" attribute.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License). To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the \"copyright\" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found. <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author> This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU Library General Public License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any later version. This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Library General Public License for more details. You should have received a copy of the GNU Library General Public License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail. You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school, if any, to sign a \"copyright disclaimer\" for the library, if necessary.

[This is the first released version of the library GPL. It is numbered 2 because it goes with version 2 of the ordinary GPL.] Preamble The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users. This license, the Library General Public License, applies to some specially designated Free Software Foundation software, and to any other libraries whose authors decide to use it. You can use it for your libraries, too. When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things. To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library, or if you modify it. For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link a program with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients so that they can relink them with the library, after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights. Our method of protecting your rights has two steps: (1) copyright the library, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library. Also, for each distributor's protection, we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free library. If the library is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original version, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations. Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that companies distributing free software will individually obtain patent licenses, thus in effect transforming the program into proprietary software. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all. Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public License, which was designed for utility programs. This license, the GNU Library General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries. This license is quite different from the ordinary one; be sure to read it in full, and don't assume that anything in it is the same as in the ordinary license. The reason we have a separate public license for some libraries is that they blur the distinction we usually make between modifying or adding to a program and simply using it. Linking a program with a library, without changing the library, is in some sense simply using the library, and is analogous to running a utility program or application program. However, in a textual and legal sense, the linked executable is a combined work, a derivative of the original library, and the ordinary General Public License treats it as such. Because of this blurred distinction, using the ordinary General Public License for libraries did not effectively promote software sharing, because most developers did not use the libraries. We concluded that weaker conditions might promote sharing better. However, unrestricted linking of non-free programs would deprive the users of those programs of all benefit from the free status of the libraries themselves. This Library General Public License is intended to permit developers of non-free programs to use free libraries, while preserving your freedom as a user of such programs to change the free libraries that are incorporated in them. (We have not seen how to achieve this as regards changes in header files, but we have achieved it as regards changes in the actual functions of the Library.) The hope is that this will lead to faster development of free libraries. The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a \"work based on the library\" and a \"work that uses the library\". The former contains code derived from the library, while the latter only works together with the library. Note that it is possible for a library to be covered by the ordinary General Public License rather than by this special one. GNU LIBRARY GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION 0. This License Agreement applies to any software library which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Library General Public License (also called \"this License\"). Each licensee is addressed as \"you\". A \"library\" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data) to form executables. The \"Library\", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been distributed under these terms. A \"work based on the Library\" means either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term \"modification\".) \"Source code\" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library. Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the Library does. 1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the Library. You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee. 2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions: a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it. Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library. In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this License. 3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices. Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy. This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program that is not a library. 4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange. If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code. 5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a \"work that uses the Library\". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License. However, linking a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a \"work that uses the library\". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables. When a \"work that uses the Library\" uses material from a header file that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law. If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.) Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself. 6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also compile or link a \"work that uses the Library\" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications. You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things: a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable \"work that uses the Library\", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. c) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place. d) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable, the required form of the \"work that uses the Library\" must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable. It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that you distribute. 7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two things: a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance. 9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it. 10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to this License. 11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Library. If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances. It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice. This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License. 12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this License. 13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Library General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and \"any later version\", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation. 14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally. NO WARRANTY 15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY \"AS IS\" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. 16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS Appendix: How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change.

If you're trying to install an earlier version, please visit: Nokogiri v1.10.x installation instructions If this document doesn't address your problem, please jump over to Getting Help . If you'd like to contribute improvements to this document, please open a GitHub issue or pull-request on nokogiri.org/installing_nokogiri.md . Installing Native Gems \u00b6 Faster, more reliable installation \u00b6 \"Native gems\" contain pre-compiled libraries for a specific machine architecture. On supported platforms, this removes the need for compiling the C extension and the packaged libraries, or for system dependencies to exist. This results in much faster installation and more reliable installation , which as you probably know are the biggest headaches for Nokogiri users. Supported Platforms \u00b6 As of v1.11.0, Nokogiri ships pre-compiled, \"native\" gems for the following platforms: Linux: x86-linux and x86_64-linux (req: glibc >= 2.17 ), including musl platforms like Alpine Darwin/MacOS: x86_64-darwin and arm64-darwin Windows: x86-mingw32 and x64-mingw32 Java: any platform running JRuby 9.2 or higher To determine whether your system supports one of these gems, look at the output of bundle platform or ruby -e 'puts Gem::Platform.local.to_s' . If you're on a supported platform, either gem install or bundle install should install a native gem without any additional action on your part. This installation should only take a few seconds, and your output should look something like: $ gem install nokogiri Fetching nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux.gem Successfully installed nokogiri-1.11.0-x86_64-linux 1 gem installed Why would I not want to use a native gem? \u00b6 I can imagine some folks might have trust issues; if this is you, please let us know in a comment at RFC: Increase the level of trust in released gem files \u00b7 Issue #2013 \u00b7 sparklemotion/nokogiri . What can we do to increase that trust? (I can imagine providing a chain of custody including public build logs with cryptographic hashes of artifacts, but I'd like to hear from real users.) Anybody on a linux system old enough to not have glibc >= 2.17 will need to install from the ruby platform gem. If you have other reasons for not wanting to use a precompiled native gem, let us know! (See Getting Help .) How can I avoid using a precompiled native gem? \u00b6 The Nokogiri maintainers strongly urge you to use a native gem if at all possible. We expect it will be a much better experience for you and allow us to focus our efforts on improving functionality rather than diagnosing installation issues. If you're on a platform that supports a native gem but you want to avoid using it in your project, do one of the following: If you're not using Bundler, then run gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby If you are using Bundler version 2.1 or later, then you'll need to run bundle config set force_ruby_platform true , version 2.0 or earlier, then you'll need to run bundle config force_ruby_platform true Installing the ruby platform gem \u00b6 Again, we recommend that you upgrade to v1.11.x and use a native gem whenever possible. If you're here, it should be because you're on an older version, or you're on an unsupported platform. Before you begin, make sure you have the full compiler toolchain for compiling Ruby C Extensions. See Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain . Installing Using The Packaged Libraries \u00b6 Nokogiri packages its own updated and patched copies of libxml2 and libxslt source code. By default, installation of Nokogiri will compile and use these packaged libraries. If you don't see your operating system / distro in this section, then no additional setup is required beyond Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain . Just run gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby . Ubuntu or Debian-based Distros sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev liblzma-dev patch gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby You may substitute git for patch ( mini_portile2 can use either for applying patches). Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS dnf install -y zlib-devel gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby OpenBSD < 6.2 Use gcc from ports in order to compile the packaged libraries: pkg_add -v gcc gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby Installing Using Standard System Libraries \u00b6 Rather than use Nokogiri's packaged versions, you may prefer to use your system's or distro's standard libxml2/libxslt libraries. This section will try to help you do that. Nokogiri will refuse to build against older, unsupported versions of libxml2 and libxslt , and there may be some behavioral changes when using older versions. If you have installed libxml2 or libxslt to a custom location, please jump to the next section, Installing With Custom / Non-Standard Libraries . If you don't see your operating system or distro listed below, then no additional setup is required beyond Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain . Just run gem install nokogiri --platform=ruby -- --use-system-libraries . Or, if you're using bundler, bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries . Debian/Ubuntu sudo apt-get install pkg-config libxml2-dev libxslt-dev gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries MacOS If you're using homebrew: brew install libxml2 libxslt gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries If you're using macports and would like to contribute documentation, please open a GitHub issue or pull-request on nokogiri.org/installing_nokogiri.md . FreeBSD sudo pkg install pkgconf gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries Windows We recommend installing Nokogiri against the MSYS2 system libraries: ridk exec pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-libxslt gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries Installing With Custom / Non-Standard Libraries \u00b6 You may have your own custom version of libxml2/libxslt that you'd like to use. OK! Here we go. Ideally you can install pkg-config and the installed libraries should self-describe how to compile and build against themselves. But if: you've got libxml2 and/or libxslt installed in a nonstandard place, and you don't have pkg-config installed ... then you can use command-line parameters to the gem install command to specify build parameters. You can specify the installation root directory: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-dir = /path/to/dir \\ --with-xslt-dir = /path/to/dir or, you can specify include and library directories separately: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib = /path/to/builds/lib \\ --with-xml2-include = /path/to/builds/include/libxml2 \\ --with-xslt-lib = /path/to/builds/lib \\ --with-xslt-include = /path/to/builds/include Note: By default, libxslt header files are installed into the root include directory, but libxml2 header files are installed into a subdirectory thereof named libxml2 . It's likely that you'll also need to specify the location of your zlib and iconv (and possibly exslt ) install directories as well. In that case, you can add the options: gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ # ... --with-iconv-dir = /path/to/dir \\ --with-zlib-dir = /path/to/dir \\ [ --with-exslt-dir = /path/to/dir ] [ --with-exslt-config = /path/to/exslt-config ] You can also tell bundler to remember these configuration parameters: bundle config build.nokogiri \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib = /usr/local/lib \\ --with-xml2-include = /usr/local/include/libxml2/libxml \\ --with-xslt-lib = /usr/local/lib \\ --with-xslt-include = /usr/local/include/libxslt \\ --with-iconv-lib = /usr/local/lib \\ --with-iconv-include = /usr/local/include Do not attempt Bundler installation using Bundler versions before v1.8.3 (see bundler/bundler#3053 for details). If you really must, see earlier git history of this file , which includes a workaround. Installing Third-Party Distributions of Nokogiri \u00b6 Debian See https://packages.debian.org/sid/ruby-nokogiri sudo apt-get install ruby-nokogiri openSUSE/SLE See https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/ruby:/extensions/ Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS You may install the appropriate epel-release and get the Nokogiri package from EPEL using: sudo dnf install -y rubygem-nokogiri GNU Guix Install on any Linux distribution using GNU Guix , a reproducible binary software package management and distribution system. Use this command: guix package -i ruby-nokogiri Note: source code is available here . A short description of how Nokogiri was packaged can be found here . Other Installation Scenarios \u00b6 Alpine Docker Images To just install the native gem: FROM ruby:3.0-alpine RUN gem install nokogiri To compile with the packaged libraries: FROM ruby:3.0-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache build-base RUN gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby To compile against Alpine's own XML libraries, add the necessary development tools and libraries to the image. FROM ruby:3.0-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev RUN gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries When optimizing the size of an Alpine image, the runtime libraries must be permanently added. Additionally, adding and removing development tooling can be chained with gem installation to ensure a small layer. FROM ruby:3.0-alpine RUN apk add --no-cache libxml2 libxslt && \\ apk add --no-cache --virtual .gem-installdeps build-base libxml2-dev libxslt-dev && \\ gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries && \\ rm -rf $GEM_HOME /cache && \\ apk del .gem-installdeps This approach nets an 12.1 MB layer (versus 18.1 MB without --use-system-libraries ) and saves over 170 MB in build tools. TermUX Although TermUX isn't fully supported right now, some people have reported success getting Nokogiri installed on it by running these commands: pkg install ruby clang make pkg-config libxslt gem install nokogiri --platform = ruby -- --use-system-libraries SmartOS (Nonstandard) SmartOS installation requires building and using libxml2/libxslt/libiconv in a nonstandard location. Building on the previous section, here's how to do it: (Note: pkgsrc is included in JPC SmartOS instances) pkgin install ruby gcc49 libxml2 libxslt zlib libiconv ruby22-rake gmake ln -s /opt/local/gcc49/bin/gcc /opt/local/bin/gcc gem install nokogiri -- \\ --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-xml2-include = /opt/local/include/libxml2 \\ --with-xslt-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-xslt-include = /opt/local/include/libxslt \\ --with-iconv-lib = /opt/local/lib \\ --with-iconv-include = /opt/local/include \\ --with-zlib-dir = /opt/local/lib See the previous section for guidance on how to instruct Bundler to use these options. Troubleshooting \u00b6 Using vendor/cache to deploy to another architecture \u00b6 A common workflow is for a team to develop on a Mac but deploy to production on Linux. This workflow depends on Bundler caching an appropriate gem file in vendor/cache . Unfortunately, in this situation Bundler's default behavior is to cache only gems for the development system and not the production system, leading to an error at deploy time. Symptoms During deployment, the buildpack may fail to find a relevant gem in vendor/cache and emit an error like this (from Heroku): -----> Ruby app detected -----> Installing bundler 2.1.4 -----> Removing BUNDLED WITH version in the Gemfile.lock -----> Compiling Ruby/Rails -----> Using Ruby version: ruby-2.7.2 -----> Installing dependencies using bundler 2.1.4 Running: BUNDLE_WITHOUT='development:test' BUNDLE_PATH=vendor/bundle BUNDLE_BIN=vendor/bundle/bin BUNDLE_DEPLOYMENT=1 bundle install -j4 Some gems seem to be missing from your vendor/cache directory. Could not find nokogiri-1.11.0 in any of the sources Bundler Output: Some gems seem to be missing from your vendor/cache directory. Could not find nokogiri-1.11.0 in any of the sources ! ! Failed to install gems via Bundler. ! ! Push rejected, failed to compile Ruby app. ! Push failed Solution Bundler 2.2 and later has great multiplatform support and allows you to cache gems for multiple platforms. You can run commands like these to cause Bundler to fetch and cache gems for all the named platforms: bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-darwin bundle lock --add-platform x86_64-linux bundle package --all-platforms For more information, please read this wonderful blog post written by Kevin Murphy explaining this approach. Fallback Solution If you can't upgrade to Bundler 2.2 (or later), you can force older versions to always use the ruby platform, which supports all platforms, but applies to all gems and comes with the installation challenges mentioned earlier in this guide. Here's how to do this with Bundler 2.1 or later: rm -rf vendor/cache bundle config set force_ruby_platform true bundle install Or if you're on version 2.0 or earlier: rm -rf vendor/cache bundle config force_ruby_platform true bundle install Cannot install racc \u00b6 As of v1.11.0, Nokogiri is declaring an explicit dependency on racc ~> 1.4 , which itself is a C extension that users may have trouble installing. Symptoms You may see an error message like this: Fetching racc 1.5.2 Installing racc 1.5.2 with native extensions Gem::Ext::BuildError: ERROR: Failed to build gem native extension. current directory: /Users/myuser2/.gem/ruby/2.7.0/gems/racc-1.5.2/ext/racc/cparse /opt/local/bin/ruby2.7 -I /opt/local/lib/ruby2.7/2.7.0 -r ./siteconf20210104-30183-axgzet.rb extconf.rb checking for rb_ary_subseq()... *** extconf.rb failed *** Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers.

See Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain . Solution 2 - Avoid installing Racc Ruby 3.0 comes with Racc 1.5.x as a \"builtin gem\", so you could update to Ruby 3! Ruby 2.7 comes with Racc 1.4.x as a \"builtin gem\", so you could use that version instead of trying to upgrade. Update to Ruby 2.7 and add a line like gem \"racc\", \"~> 1.4.0\" to prevent bundler from trying to upgrade. [Linux] /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp \u00b6 If you're compiling the ruby platform gem, and if you've installed Ruby using RVM, you may require libgmp . Symptoms Gem installation fails with an error message like: /home/user/.rvm/rubies/ruby-2.2.3/lib/ruby/2.2.0/mkmf.rb:456:in ` try_do ' : The compiler failed to generate an executable file. ( RuntimeError ) You have to install development tools first. And examination of your mkmf.log file shows: /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lgmp Solution Run sudo apt-get install libgmp-dev . [MacOS] xcode-select errors with a 'network problem' \u00b6 If you're compiling the ruby platform gem ... Symptoms You see this dialog when you run the commands to update xcode commandline tools: Solution Run this command to turn off forced-authentication with Apple Software Update: sudo defaults delete /Library/Preferences/com.apple.SoftwareUpdate CatalogURL [MacOS] error: use of undeclared identifier 'LZMA_OK' \u00b6 If you're compiling the ruby platform gem ... Symptoms An error during Nokogiri installation mentions an undeclared identifier LZMA_OK : xmlIO.c:1450:52: error: use of undeclared identifier 'LZMA_OK' ret = (__libxml2_xzclose((xzFile) context) == LZMA_OK ) ? 0 : -1; ^ 1 error generated. Diagnosis When using Homebrew, there are several libraries that use a formula called xz (including the_silver_searcher and imagemagick ), which by default install a version of liblzma that is incompatible with most Ruby builds. (Homebrew installs only the 64-bit version of the library, but most Ruby builds are universal.) This can be fixed in a couple of ways: Solution 1 The most reliable solution appears to be temporarily unlinking xz and relinking it during an install of nokogiri : brew unlink xz gem install nokogiri # or bundle install brew link xz Solution 2 The other solution is to use a Homebrew-installed libxml2 , as suggested in Installing Using Standard System Libraries . brew install libxml2 gem install nokogiri -- --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include = $( brew --prefix libxml2 ) /include/libxml2 or if you're using bundler: bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries \\ --with-xml2-include = $( brew --prefix libxml2 ) /include/libxml2 bundle install When working with this, be certain to use $(brew --prefix libxml2) because it will use the correct location for your Homebrew install. [MacOS] libiconv is missing \u00b6 Xcode 10 on macOS Mojave moves the system headers out of /usr/include and so Nokogiri will fail to build when you're compiling the ruby platform gem. Symptoms You'll see an error similar to this: Building nokogiri using packaged libraries. libiconv is missing. please visit http://nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html for help with installing dependencies. *** extconf.rb failed *** Could not create Makefile due to some reason, probably lack of necessary libraries and/or headers. Solution A temporary workaround to allow previous releases of Nokogiri to build is to install the extra headers package mentioned in the Xcode 10 release notes: open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg You can also install the headers package from the command line (e.g. for a build script or a CI server): sudo installer -pkg /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg -target / [MacOS] General MacOS Tips \u00b6 If you're seeing other problems: Make sure ruby is compiled with the latest clang compiler. Binary gems and ruby should be compiled with the same compiler/environment. If you have multiple versions of Xcode installed, make sure you use the right xcode-select . Try Installing Using Standard System Libraries . Appendix A: The Compiler Toolchain \u00b6 A good way to tell if you've got your basic Ruby C extension compiler toolchain installed correctly is to try installing the bcrypt gem which has a smaller, self-contained C extension. If you can gem install bcrypt , you're all set! Reminder: if you're installing a native gem, you don't need to do this. Ubuntu or Debian-based Distros \u00b6 sudo apt-get install build-essential ruby-dev Fedora, Red Hat, and CentOS \u00b6 dnf install -y make gcc rpm-build ruby-devel Alpine \u00b6 apk add build-base Windows \u00b6 Please visit RubyInstaller and make sure you install a version \"With Devkit\". MacOS \u00b6 First, make sure you have the latest version of RubyGems and xcode commandline tools: gem update --system xcode-select --install # Then agree to the terms, even if you have done this before!

Why is HTML5 parsing covered as a separate tutorial from HTML parsing ? Eventually, we'll integrate HTML5 docs into the other of tutorials, and this page will go away. We shipped HTML5 support as quickly as possible by copying (and only lightly editing) the Nokogumbo documentation to this page. HTML5 support is only in v1.12.0 and later. This tutorial describes functionality that is only available in Nokogiri v1.12.0 and later. Please visit the HTML5 API documentation for more information. HTML5 functionality is not available when running JRuby. The JRuby implementation of Nokogiri does not support HTML5 as of v1.12.0. If you'd like to help implement this support, or would like to know more, please see #2227 . Usage \u00b6 Parse an HTML5 document: doc = Nokogiri . HTML5 ( string ) Parse an HTML5 fragment: fragment = Nokogiri :: HTML5 . fragment ( string ) Parsing options \u00b6 The document and fragment parsing methods support options that are different from Nokogiri's. Nokogiri.HTML5(html, url = nil, encoding = nil, options = {}) Nokogiri::HTML5.parse(html, url = nil, encoding = nil, options = {}) Nokogiri::HTML5::Document.parse(html, url = nil, encoding = nil, options = {}) Nokogiri::HTML5.fragment(html, encoding = nil, options = {}) Nokogiri::HTML5::DocumentFragment.parse(html, encoding = nil, options = {}) The three currently supported options are :max_errors , :max_tree_depth and :max_attributes , described below. Error reporting \u00b6 Nokogiri contains an experimental HTML5 parse error reporting facility. By default, no parse errors are reported but this can be configured by passing the :max_errors option to HTML5.parse or HTML5.fragment . For example, this script: doc = Nokogiri :: HTML5 . parse ( '<span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar />' , max_errors : 10 ) doc . errors . each do | err | puts ( err ) end Emits: 1:1: ERROR: Expected a doctype token <span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar /> ^ 1:1: ERROR: Start tag of nonvoid HTML element ends with '/>', use '>'. <span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar /> ^ 1:17: ERROR: End tag ends with '/>', use '>'. <span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar /> ^ 1:17: ERROR: End tag contains attributes. <span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar /> ^ Using max_errors: -1 results in an unlimited number of errors being returned. The HTML standard defines a number of standard parse error codes. These error codes only cover the \"tokenization\" stage of parsing HTML. The parse errors in the \"tree construction\" stage do not have standardized error codes (yet). As a convenience to Nokogiri users, the defined error codes are available via Nokogiri::XML::SyntaxError#str1 method: doc = Nokogiri :: HTML5 . parse ( '<span/>Hi there!</span foo=bar />' , max_errors : 10 ) doc . errors . each do | err | puts ( \" #{ err . line } : #{ err . column } : #{ err . str1 } \" ) end # => 1:1: generic-parser # 1:1: non-void-html-element-start-tag-with-trailing-solidus # 1:17: end-tag-with-trailing-solidus # 1:17: end-tag-with-attributes Note that the first error is generic-parser because it's an error from the tree construction stage and doesn't have a standardized error code. For the purposes of semantic versioning, the error messages, error locations, and error codes are not part of Nokogiri's public API. That is, these are subject to change without Nokogiri's major version number changing. These may be stabilized in the future. Maximum tree depth \u00b6 The maximum depth of the DOM tree parsed by the various parsing methods is configurable by the :max_tree_depth option. If the depth of the tree would exceed this limit, then an ::ArgumentError is thrown. This limit (which defaults to Nokogiri::Gumbo::DEFAULT_MAX_TREE_DEPTH = 400 ) can be removed by giving the option max_tree_depth: -1 . html = '<!DOCTYPE html>' + '<div>' * 1000 doc = Nokogiri . HTML5 ( html ) # raises ArgumentError: Document tree depth limit exceeded doc = Nokogiri . HTML5 ( html , max_tree_depth : - 1 ) Attribute limit per element \u00b6 The maximum number of attributes per DOM element is configurable by the :max_attributes option. If a given element would exceed this limit, then an ::ArgumentError is thrown. This limit (which defaults to Nokogiri::Gumbo::DEFAULT_MAX_ATTRIBUTES = 400 ) can be removed by giving the option max_attributes: -1 . html = '<!DOCTYPE html><div ' + ( 1 .. 1000 ) . map { | x | \"attr- #{ x } \" } . join ( ' ' ) + '>' # \"<!DOCTYPE html><div attr-1 attr-2 attr-3 ... attr-1000>\" doc = Nokogiri . HTML5 ( html ) # raises ArgumentError: Attributes per element limit exceeded doc = Nokogiri . HTML5 ( html , max_attributes : - 1 ) HTML Serialization \u00b6 After parsing HTML, it may be serialized using any of the Nokogiri::XML::Node serialization methods. In particular, XML::Node#serialize , #to_html , and #to_s will serialize a given node and its children. (This is the equivalent of JavaScript's Element.outerHTML .) Similarly, XML::Node#inner_html will serialize the children of a given node. (This is the equivalent of JavaScript's Element.innerHTML .) doc = Nokogiri :: HTML5 ( \"<!DOCTYPE html><span>Hello world!</span>\" ) puts doc . serialize # => <!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><span>Hello world!</span></body></html> Notes \u00b6 The Nokogiri::HTML5.fragment function takes a string and parses it as a HTML5 document. The <html> , <head> , and <body> elements are removed from this document, and any children of these elements that remain are returned as a Nokogiri::HTML5::DocumentFragment . The Nokogiri::HTML5.parse function takes a string and passes it to the gumbo_parse_with_options method, using the default options. The resulting Gumbo parse tree is then walked. Instead of uppercase element names, lowercase element names are produced. Instead of returning unknown as the element name for unknown tags, the original tag name is returned verbatim.","title":"Parsing an HTML5 document"},{"location":"tutorials/parsing_an_html5_document.html#parsing-an-html5-document","text":"Nokogiri provides the ability for a Ruby program to invoke our version of the Gumbo HTML5 parser and to access the result as a Nokogiri::HTML::Document .

Really! We're here to make your life easier. html_doc = Nokogiri :: HTML ( \"<html><body><h1>Mr. Belvedere Fan Club</h1></body></html>\" ) xml_doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( \"<root><aliens><alien><name>Alf</name></alien></aliens></root>\" ) The variables html_doc and xml_doc are Nokogiri documents, which have all kinds of interesting properties and methods that you can read about here . We'll cover the interesting bits in other chapters. From a File \u00b6 Note that you don't need to read the file into a string variable. Nokogiri will do this for you. doc = File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" ) { | f | Nokogiri :: XML ( f ) } Clever Nokogiri! With the time you just saved, approach enlightenment by meditating on this koan . From the Internets \u00b6 I understand that there may be some HTML documents available on the World Wide Web. require 'open-uri' doc = Nokogiri :: HTML ( URI . open ( \"http://www.threescompany.com/\" )) Parse Options \u00b6 Nokogiri offers quite a few options that affect how a document is parsed; you can read about them in the XML::ParseOptions docs . Notably, Nokogiri will treat input as untrusted documents by default, thereby avoiding a class of vulnerabilities known as XXE or \"XML eXternal Entity\" processing. What this means is that Nokogiri won't attempt to load external DTDs or access the network for any external resources. Some commonly-used parse options are: NONET - Prevent any network connections during parsing. Recommended for parsing untrusted documents. This is set by default! RECOVER - Attempt to recover from errors. Recommended for parsing malformed or invalid documents. This is set by default! NOBLANKS - Remove blank nodes NOENT - Substitute entities NOERROR - Suppress error reports STRICT - Strict parsing; raise an error when parsing malformed documents DTDLOAD and DTDVALID - If you want DTD validation HUGE - use to skip hardcoded limits around document size or DOM depth; comes with a performance penalty You could use them by handcrafting an artisanal bitmap (not recommended): doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . options = Nokogiri :: XML :: ParseOptions :: STRICT | Nokogiri :: XML :: ParseOptions :: NOBLANKS end But it's more idiomatic to use the chainable shortcuts on the config object instead: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . strict . noblanks end Notably, if you want to turn off an option that's set by default, you can prefix a \"no\" to the config shortcut: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . norecover end Leading to the perhaps-surprising (but logical!) nononet to turn networking back on: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . nononet end Encoding \u00b6 Strings are always stored as UTF-8 internally. Methods that return text values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings. Methods that return XML (like to_xml, to_html and inner_html) will return a string encoded like the source document. WARNING Some documents declare one particular encoding, but use a different one. So, which encoding should the parser choose? Remember that data is just a stream of bytes. Only us humans add meaning to that stream. Any particular set of bytes could be valid characters in multiple encodings, so detecting encoding with 100% accuracy is not possible. libxml2 does its best, but it can't be right 100% of the time. If you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your best bet is to explicitly set the encoding. Here is an example of explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser: doc = Nokogiri .

Notably, Nokogiri will treat input as untrusted documents by default, thereby avoiding a class of vulnerabilities known as XXE or \"XML eXternal Entity\" processing. What this means is that Nokogiri won't attempt to load external DTDs or access the network for any external resources. Some commonly-used parse options are: NONET - Prevent any network connections during parsing. Recommended for parsing untrusted documents. This is set by default! RECOVER - Attempt to recover from errors. Recommended for parsing malformed or invalid documents. This is set by default! NOBLANKS - Remove blank nodes NOENT - Substitute entities NOERROR - Suppress error reports STRICT - Strict parsing; raise an error when parsing malformed documents DTDLOAD and DTDVALID - If you want DTD validation HUGE - use to skip hardcoded limits around document size or DOM depth; comes with a performance penalty You could use them by handcrafting an artisanal bitmap (not recommended): doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . options = Nokogiri :: XML :: ParseOptions :: STRICT | Nokogiri :: XML :: ParseOptions :: NOBLANKS end But it's more idiomatic to use the chainable shortcuts on the config object instead: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . strict . noblanks end Notably, if you want to turn off an option that's set by default, you can prefix a \"no\" to the config shortcut: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . norecover end Leading to the perhaps-surprising (but logical!) nononet to turn networking back on: doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . open ( \"blossom.xml\" )) do | config | config . nononet end","title":"Parse Options"},{"location":"tutorials/parsing_an_html_xml_document.html#encoding","text":"Strings are always stored as UTF-8 internally. Methods that return text values will always return UTF-8 encoded strings. Methods that return XML (like to_xml, to_html and inner_html) will return a string encoded like the source document. WARNING Some documents declare one particular encoding, but use a different one. So, which encoding should the parser choose? Remember that data is just a stream of bytes. Only us humans add meaning to that stream. Any particular set of bytes could be valid characters in multiple encodings, so detecting encoding with 100% accuracy is not possible. libxml2 does its best, but it can't be right 100% of the time. If you want Nokogiri to handle the document encoding properly, your best bet is to explicitly set the encoding. Here is an example of explicitly setting the encoding to EUC-JP on the parser: doc = Nokogiri .

Single Results \u00b6 If you know you're going to get only a single result back, you can use the shortcuts at_css and at_xpath instead of having to access the first element of a NodeSet. @doc . css ( \"dramas name\" ) . first # => \"<name>The A-Team</name>\" @doc . at_css ( \"dramas name\" ) # => \"<name>The A-Team</name>\" Namespaces \u00b6 Just like our Ruby code, XML can suffer from name collisions. For example, an autoparts dealer can sell tires and so can a bike dealer. Both of them may use a \"tire\" tag to describe the tires they sell. However, we need to be able to tell the difference between a car tire and a bike tire . This is where namespaces come to the rescue. Namespaces associate tags with a unique URL. Let's take a look at the autoparts store's XML versus the bike stores: [parts.xml] <parts> <!-- Alice's Auto Parts Store --> <inventory xmlns= \"http://alicesautoparts.com/\" > <tire> all weather </tire> <tire> studded </tire> <tire> extra wide </tire> </inventory> <!-- Bob's Bike Shop --> <inventory xmlns= \"http://bobsbikes.com/\" > <tire> street </tire> <tire> mountain </tire> </inventory> </parts> Since the URLs are unique, we can associate our query with a URL and get only the tires belonging to that url: @doc = Nokogiri :: XML ( File . read ( \"parts.xml\" )) car_tires = @doc . xpath ( '//car:tire' , 'car' => 'http://alicesautoparts.com/' ) # => [\"<tire>all weather</tire>\", # \"<tire>studded</tire>\", # \"<tire>extra wide</tire>\"] bike_tires = @doc . xpath ( '//bike:tire' , 'bike' => 'http://bobsbikes.com/' ) # => [\"<tire>street</tire>\", \"<tire>mountain</tire>\"] To make this namespace registration a bit easier, nokogiri will automatically register any namespaces it finds on the root node for you . Nokogiri will associate the name in the declaration with the supplied URL. If we stick to this naming convention, we can shorten up our code. Let's take this atom feed for example: [atom.xml] <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?> <feed xmlns= \"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\" > <title> Example Feed </title> <link href= \"http://example.org/\" /> <updated> 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z </updated> <author> <name> John Doe </name> </author> <id> urn:uuid:60a76c80-d399-11d9-b93C-0003939e0af6 </id> <entry> <title> Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok </title> <link href= \"http://example.org/2003/12/13/atom03\" /> <id> urn:uuid:1225c695-cfb8-4ebb-aaaa-80da344efa6a </id> <updated> 2003-12-13T18:30:02Z </updated> <summary> Some text. </summary> </entry> </feed> If we stick to the convention, we can grab all title tags like this @doc . xpath ( '//xmlns:title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] Don't be fooled though. You do not have to use XPath to get the benefits of namespaces. CSS selectors can be used as well. CSS just uses the pipe symbol to indicate a namespace search. Let's see the previous search rewritten to use CSS: @doc . css ( 'xmlns|title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] When using CSS, if the namespace is called \"xmlns\", you can even omit the namespace name. That means your CSS will reduce to: @doc . css ( 'title' ) # => [\"<title>Example Feed</title>\", \"<title>Atom-Powered Robots Run Amok</title>\"] Dealing with namespaces is a broad topic. If you need more examples, be sure to check out this blog post or send an email to the mailing list , and we can help out. But I'm Lazy and Don't Want to Deal With Namespaces! \u00b6 Lazy == Efficient, so no judgements. :) If you have an XML document with namespaces, but would prefer to ignore them entirely (and query as if Tim Bray had never invented them), then you can call remove_namespaces! on an XML::Document to remove all namespaces. Of course, if the document had nodes with the same names but different namespaces, they will now be ambiguous. But you're lazy! You don't care! Slop 1 \u00b6 Maybe you want a more interactive (read: sloppy) way to access nodes and attributes.
